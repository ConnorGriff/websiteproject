    <P> 
        1.1: IT has several purposes in business, from the customer-facing side to the employee and owner side. As IT and technology itself has developed we first saw growth on the business side, with growth through the analogue revolution through to the digital revolution we live in today. The role IT takes today is for security, ease of access, maintenance, and upkeep of digital infrastructure. With the world being fully invested in the digital era we find ourselves in, IT is an essential role in the modern era, without it as we have seen in this early part of 2020 a lot of businesses would not be able to function, as those that have a digital presence and that are able to operate online will far outmanoeuvre those that didn’t make the leap. 
    </P>
        1.2: Out of everything you need to complete and attempt a digital project, the first two things you need are a computer (or a device that you can work on) and a connection to the internet. Without those two it will be very difficult to go anywhere with a project. There are a few skills required in order to carry out a project as well, firstly is the ability to manage the scope of the project, not going too big that it’s outside of what you can do, and secondly the ability to manage your time and make sure that you give yourself the ability to do everything you set out to do. The resources required also tie back into the first part, all you need is a computer and a connection to the internet, then that’ll give you access to websites like stack overflow, Reddit, and well the rest of whatever you can find on google to help you.
    </P>  
        1.3: To undertake this project I broke it down into sections, first to tackle the questions and writing portion first, making sure that in order to build the website, I first had a skeleton to build it around. Second I built a Trello (well at the same time as writing) which broke down into sections making it easy to visualise what I had completed, what has to be completed, and if I had made any progress with a section I was finding difficult. <a href="https://trello.com/b/w0QgmFfL/connors-website-project"> A link to my trello board</a>
    
    </P>
        1.4: When undertaking any project there are going to be risks and shortcomings that will have to be addressed. One of the first ones that is addressed, especially in this modern world is security, the second will be making sure all the parts can come together properly and lastly is not becoming too big and failing because you overshot what you were capable of. One big reason for failure is the project simply being too large and needing too much investment in order to return on it, we can take several examples from Google as they have seen this happen multiple times with some of their endeavours. Google+, Google glasses and potentially more recently, Google Stadia. Two of these projects are already gone and for a few years it seemed like there would be potential behind them; however, it seems from what Google set out to do they weren’t prepared to go the distance and cover all the costs in order to make sure that they had a successful project in the long term. 
    </P>   
        1.5: The best way to select what systems you need is understanding what’s needed for the project and how these systems or programs or hardware match with the budget for the project. For example, if you’re hosting an online shop or retailing site or a video sharing site, a larger budget allocated for server space will be required. However, if you’re designing a system that runs completely locally and doesn’t require a server to function, maybe spending more or allocating more towards getting more features or functionality will be the priority. Really this is all about the balance in what you’re given vs what you want to achieve. Sometimes you want a better version of a piece of software or hardware, but doing so will mean you go over budget, so taking a sacrifice in features in order to make sure that the budget wasn’t broken. 
    </P>   
        1.6: The major software utilized for this project and programs used to help me achieve my goals were thankfully all free to use. From Google Documents where I wrote all this up, to Trello where I planned it all out, to VS Code where I wrote the code, to finally GitHub where I hosted this site. All these programs helped me complete this project through two major ways, one they are easy to use and have a low barrier to entry, and secondly, they helped me understand how more systems worked together. Through a demonstration from our instructors, it was easy to see how these systems and programs are used in a professional work environment and how people working in tech industries or any industry that utilises IT specialists would come to see these as a staple in their arsenal for coding. 
    </P>    
        1.7: Some major changes came into GDPR back in 2018 which were designed to protect the personal information of the general public. The main guidelines for GDPR are “data portability, the right to be forgotten, the right to prevent profiling, the right to object to processing, the right to rectification and erasure, and subject access requests.” What this means for new projects and even existing projects and programs is they now need to be conscious of what data they are storing, how they’re going to use it, and how can they keep it secure so many projects that need or require people’s data may just be dead in the water if they’re unable to comply with any of these.
