        3.1:  I think in terms of efficiency, yes I could have been much more efficient in my workflow. For example, I wrote all this in Google Docs, and then pasted and formatted it into VS Code. There would be a more efficient way to execute this if I could find a way to input it correctly into VS directly without having to go through another application which while it may be a worse idea in terms of backing up my work, that’s always a factor that should be taken into account. Another efficiency problem that was not necessarily a fault but an inevitability was having to go back and forth a lot. Due to being new to both HTML and CSS, I had to go back and forth on this project to learn more things about what I was doing in order to finish the project. Which is to be expected fully but caused some problems in the workflow as it wasn’t as smooth as It could have been.

        In terms of working in teams, I think that this project wouldn’t necessarily be the best option, as not only would it add more work in the planning/design stages, it could create tensions or disagreements if the two or more people working on the project couldn’t agree on a design, or how to divide up the workflow. 
    </p>

       3.2: A singular way I would have improved the workflow would be to streamline what I was working on better. I was flip-flopping a lot due to the order in which we were being taught and my inexperience with what I was working on. In terms of productivity, I should have set myself more personal deadlines instead of kind of doing odd things at odd times. That was one major drawback of working on everything in stages like this, it did make it a bit harder to visualise the deadlines in my head.

        3.3: A solution I would use for improving productivity would be using Trello more in terms of setting reminders and due dates for personal use, for example saying that part of project x has to be done at 3 pm on the 6th of April as opposed to I’ll do this little bit later. I think using slack would be a good way to perhaps set more reminders as well reinforcement through other people, asking them to check your work at certain times, to make sure it was all up to scratch. Teamwork again I don’t think would have improved overall productivity however there are ways it could have, it would make dividing up the writing work easier, and perhaps if the team came to an easy compromise over the design and layout of the website then dividing up the workflow would be much simpler.

        3.4: Testing digital solutions was an essential part of getting this project to work. From testing my layout with HTML as the first part to make sure everything roughly looked how I wanted it to. This process was basically me messing around with having different pages, and different styles and ways I wanted to lay it out, then saving the changes and refreshing the page to see how that would change it. There was a similar process with the CSS, having the design template or layout I had in mind, then making changes in order to make it line up with what I wanted, and just refreshing and changing as I went along in order for it to meet my vision.
