    <h2>Unit 1</h2>

        2.1: Whilst taking this course we weren’t presented with a whole lot of programs to choose from, we have to use Trello and VS Code for example, however even if we were given a choice I can see why these programs were clear winners and why they were chosen by the staff. Being both free and easy and simple to use, I was very happy with using them, they were fun to mess about with and learn about, and pretty straight forward when it came to actually write code in VS or changing tasks to do in my Trello, to make sure I’m sticking on task.

        2.2: For beginners like myself the tools we were provided were appropriate for the work we were undertaking. Working with a wide variety of code, examples and being students we didn’t need anything too intensive or much of a ‘premium’ product to get the work done. If we were more advanced or if we were working on much more complex problems or on a more specific task, then perhaps other tools and programs would have been better. However, due to the nature of the course, having these available to use and work with was probably the best option.

        2.3: In terms of design, I would say I’m happy with my project. I set myself a reasonable goal, and I think I achieved it. In terms of my design principles I’ve always thought less is more and that in order to best show myself to the world in my first proper online project I would go for something that I think reflected me best. I think I would change however the focus, I think in future I would like to make a more personal website in the future one that not only reflects my design focus but also one that reflects me better and I could use as a reference and contact point for myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        2.4: I think I would like more integration of other projects I undertook in the future. For example if I undertook and photography or photoshop projects, or video editing or video publishing projects, it would be a fantastic way to host them and show off my various talents, if I ever put more time into developing them. 

    </p>
    <p>
        2.5: The requirements that were set out for me was to answer these coursework questions, make a website and use it to host these questions. The outcome was exactly as I hoped and worked well for what I was looking for.
