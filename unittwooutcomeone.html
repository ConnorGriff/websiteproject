    <h1>Unit 2 Outcome 1.</h1>
   <h2>Unit 2</h2>
    <p>
        1.1: The content of each page is a simple layout. I divided each of the units and outcomes into a separate page, and then had a welcome/landing page, and an about me/contact me page. I felt like this was the most logical layout for the feel/design I was going for as it fits excellently for the type of image I was trying to broadcast through executing this project.

        /1.5: Copyright is a large constraint on websites today, and it comes in 2 major forms. Media used on the website if not original work by the project creators has to be licenced and authorised for use by the original creator, which if not done, can lead to a copyright claim and a fine. Secondly, it’s also for the name/branding of the website, similar to the first but different slightly, for example even if I used no reference to IKEA in terms of media references (colours, logo, style/branding) I couldn’t call my website IKEA for fears of their legal team filing a copyright claim against me. Now there are some exceptions to this granted, for example there is an eSports team called Dignitas, and there is a service in Switzerland that specialises in euthanasia called project Dignitas as well. Now one hasn’t tried to copyright claim the other because of the two companies being in two widely different industries and not competing with one another, and not having any overlap whatsoever.

        1.6: Some of the most obvious disabilities that many websites take into account are visual impairment or audio impairment as that ease of access that people without disabilities like myself take for granted, others, unfortunately, aren’t so lucky. The way around these are usually closed captions for any video media that plays, or even visual descriptions of what’s going on for each disability respectively and as well as audio descriptions. Another less common thought about ease of access is for those with learning difficulties like ADHD/ADD, dyslexia, or any other form. People with dyslexia often find it easier to read and understand what they’re reading in certain font size and coloured backgrounds/text. Similarly, people with ADHD/ADD find it easier to absorb information if it is presented in a different way, making sure that any important/essential information that is conveyed is done so and is fully understood.

        1.7: There are only certain file types that websites will accept, but there are quite a few of them out there. For example, there is .avi, an audio/video format. .DOC, which is a Microsoft word document. A very common one in today’s world is a .GIF format, which is simply put a video snippet with no audio. More common ones that will be found are .JPG/.PNG files which are two separate image file formats. And lastly but not least there’s .HTML which is of course what this website is written in, and as are most other websites. These are just some of the more common filetypes used in websites/web design, but there are many more to be used adding more layers of creativity and design choices for creators and project designers.
